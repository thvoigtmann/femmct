# FEM-MCT
Finite-Element Method solver combined with the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition, to predict flow properties of viscoelastic shear-thinning / yield-stress fluids using a microscopically derived constitutive equation.

For application of the code, see [Steinh√§user, Treskatis, Turek, and Voigtmann, arXiv:2307.12764 (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12764).
